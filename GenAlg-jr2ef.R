# The genetic algorithm will tackle a problem facing elementary school kids for 
# ages - what is the fewest number of coins required to produce change, when the
# cost is rounded to the nearest dollar?

# To do this, each gene on a chromosome will represent a type of coin, with the 
# value being the number of coins used. A vector of weights holds the
# denominations of each coin:

weights <- c(0.01,0.05,0.10,0.25,0.50,1.00)

# The following evaluation function attempts to minimize the number of coins
e <- function(obj){
  # Round the floats, so as to return integers (The Brits *did* kill off the
  # halfpenny in the 60's, after all)
  rounded <- round(obj,digits = 0)
  # Round the cost up to the dollar, and subtract the cost to find the
  # amount of change required.
  change <- ceiling(target) - target
  # Find the total value by taking the dot product of the number of coins and their weights
  totValue <- rounded%*%weights
  # The difference between the required change and solutions in the population 
  # needs to be minimized. Taking the absolute value ensures that 0 will be the 
  # lowest number returned.
  difference <- abs(change-totValue)
  
  # find the cumulative sum of all coin types, from lowest to highest denominations
  values <- cumsum(rounded*weights)
  
  # The number of coins also needs to be minimized. If the cumulative sum of the
  # smaller denominations is greater than a larger denomination, the solution is
  # not optimal. Thus, we penalize the difference by summing the number of
  # suboptimal valuations.
  penalty <- (values[1] > weights[2]) +
    (values[2] > weights[3]) +
    (values[3] > weights[4]) + 
    (values[4] > weights[5]) +
    (values[5] > weights[6])
